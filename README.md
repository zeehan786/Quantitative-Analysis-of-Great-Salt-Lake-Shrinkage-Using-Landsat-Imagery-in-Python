Leveraged multi-year Landsat images from 2001 to 2021 to conduct a detailed analysis of the Great Salt Lake's shrinkage, demonstrating advanced expertise in remote sensing and environmental monitoring. Calculated the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) using NIR and green bands to differentiate water bodies from non-water areas, showcasing proficiency in satellite image processing. Developed a Python-based automated pipeline for computing NDWI, classifying water bodies, and measuring water area across different years. Achieved precise quantification of the lakeâ€™s shrinking area over time, revealing significant trends in water loss due to environmental factors.
